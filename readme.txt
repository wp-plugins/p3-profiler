Requires at least: 3.3
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 1.1.1

See which plugins are slowing down your site.  This plugin creates a performance report for your site.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a profile of your WordPress site's plugins' performance by measuring their impact on your site's load time.  Often times, WordPress sites load slowly because of poorly configured plugins or because there are so many of them. By using the P3 plugin, you can narrow down anything causing slowness on your site.

This plugin uses the canvas element for drawing charts and requires requires Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, or IE9 or later.  This plugin will not work in IE8 or lower.

== Screenshots ==

1. First, profile your site.  The scanner generates some traffic on your site and monitors your site's performance on the server, then shows you the results. With this information, you can decide what action to take.
2. After profiling, you'll see a breakdown of relative runtime for each plugin.
3. Callouts at the top give you quick information like how much load time (in seconds) is dedicated to plugins and how many database queries your site is running per page.
4. The detailed timeline gives you timing information for every plugin, the theme, and the core for every page during the profile.  Find out exactly what's happening on slow loading pages.
5. You can toggle each series on and off to customize this timeline for your precise needs.
6. The query timeline gives you the number of database queries for every page during the profile.  Find out which pages generate the most database queries.
7. Keep a history of your performance scans, compare your current performance with your previous performance.
8. Full in-app help documentation
9. Send a summary of your performance profile via e-mail.  If you want to show your developer, site admin, hosting support, or a plugin developer what's going on with your site, this is good way to start the conversation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I get a warning about usort()? =

Warning messages like this: `Warning: usort() [function.usort]: Array was modified by the user comparison function` are due to a known php bug.  See [php bug #50688](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50688) for more information.  This warning does not affect the functionality of your site and it is not visible to your users.

= In the e-mail report, why is my theme detected as "unknown?" =

Previous version of the plugin (before 1.1.0) did not have theme name detection support.  If you performed a scan with a previous version, then upgraded to 1.1.0+ to view the scan, the theme name will show as "unknown."
